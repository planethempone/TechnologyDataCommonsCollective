Onboarding Script: Technology & Data Commons Collective (TDCC)

Welcome, Architect of the Commons. Joining the TDCC means you are now a guardian of the Green Renaissance’s digital integrity. We don't just write code; we build homeostatic systems.

This script is designed to be added to your .github/ folder as ONBOARDING.md or pinned in the TDCC Discussions.

1. The Digital Handshake (First 24 Hours)

Before touching the codebase, every TDCC developer must establish their Sovereign Presence.

[ ] Authenticate via Virtual Identity: Ensure your GitHub account is linked to your Planet Hemp Virtual ID. We use signed commits to ensure every "Imprint" is traceable to a real contributor.

[ ] Join the HempNet Discord/Slack: Enter the #tdcc-forge channel and introduce yourself with your specialty (e.g., "Full-stack / G-Code Optimization").

[ ] Claim your Onboarding XP: Navigate to the Landing Platform and input your first "System Contribution" ticket to begin your ascent to Sovereign status.

2. System Architecture & Context

The TDCC operates on the ECS-as-homeostasis model. Familiarize yourself with our "Biological Logic" before diving into the repos:

The Nexus (RI): Our "Brain." Understand how the Regenerative Intelligence aggregates data.

The Cold Bridge: Our decentralized storage layer. Data here is "Common Wealth."

The Global Hemp Ledger: Our financial backbone. Every industrial action is a transaction.

3. Local Environment Setup

Clone the "Forge" meta-repository to pull the core dependencies:

Bash



# Clone the TDCC Core Forge
git clone https://github.com/planethempone/tdcc-core.git

# Navigate and install dependencies
cd tdcc-core
npm install

# Initialize your local 'Cold Bridge' node
npm run nexus:init


Important: Create a .env file based on .env.example. You will need your Nexus API Key to pull real-time soil data from the Eco-Guardian Network for testing.

4. The Contribution Workflow (The Pulse)

We follow a Trunk-Based Development model to ensure our "digital heartbeat" is constant.

Select a Pulse: Pick a task from the TDCC Project Board. Labels range from refactor:calibration to feat:industrial-gcode.

Branching: Use the naming convention imprint/your-name/task-description.

The "Homeostatic" PR: Every Pull Request must include:

Impact Statement: How does this change affect the Equity Index 2.0?

Carbon Footprint: Is this code energy-efficient? (Check against our green-lint standards).

Sovereign Review: All code must be reviewed by at least one Level 5 Sovereign before merging into the main branch.

5. Mentorship & Support

If you feel lost in the Nexus, do not hesitate to reach out:

The Documentation: Check the /docs folder in the Vision repository.

The Forge-Master: Ping @Sovereign_Dev in the GitHub Discussions for architectural questions.

Pair Programming: Every Tuesday at 14:00 UTC, we host "Synergy Sprints"—open Zoom/Jitsi rooms for collaborative coding.

"The code we write today is the soil our children will walk on tomorrow."
